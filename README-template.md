  </div>
  <div class="card__title">Sedans</div>
  <div class="card__description">
    Choose a sedan for its affordability and excellent fuel
    economy. Ideal for cruising in the city or on your next
    road trip.
  </div>
  <div class="card__button">
    <button>Learn more</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
.app .main-container {
  width: 85%;
  background-color: rgb(139, 139, 9);
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 6rem 3rem;
